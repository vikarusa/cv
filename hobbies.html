      <li>
        I love taking pictures, especially ones at night. Click
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/photography.vsem/">here </a>to visit my photography website.

      <li>I love astronomy, looking at the stars amazes me of what is beyond their existance.</li>
      <li>I enjoy baking. My favorite thing to make is chocolate cake. Eating it is the best part though.</li>
      <li>Drawing is not my best skill, but I enjoy doing it.</li>
      <li>
        I like to read, only certain books though. That includes "All Out of Pretty." It's hard for me to find books I
        enjoy.

      <li>I also like to take care of myself, like having spa days :).</li>
